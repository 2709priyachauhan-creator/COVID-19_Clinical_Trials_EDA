# COVID-19 Clinical Trials Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 
clinical trials data from ClinicalTrials.gov to understand global research efforts 
and identify trends in pandemic response.

## Objectives

- Analyze geographic distribution of clinical trials
- Understand trial characteristics (status, phase, type)
- Examine demographic patterns in research
- Identify temporal trends
- Discover research gaps and opportunities

## Tools and Technologies

- Python 3.11+
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- NumPy (numerical operations)
- Matplotlib (visualization)
- Seaborn (statistical visualization)
- Visual Studio Code
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

- Source: ClinicalTrials.gov (National Institute of Health)
- Scope: COVID-19 related clinical trials
- Format: CSV
- Size: 5,000+ trials

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this project
2. Install dependencies: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
3. Open COVID19_Clinical_Trials_EDA.ipynb in VS Code or Jupyter
4. Run all cells sequentially

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Cleaning
3. Feature Engineering
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Insights and Conclusions

## Key Findings

- Concentrated research activity in North America and Europe
- Majority of trials target adult populations
- Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials most common
- Significant variation in enrollment sizes
- Peak activity in 2020-2021

## Insights

- Geographic gaps in underrepresented regions
- Limited pediatric trials
- Opportunity for large-scale population studies
- Need for long-term Phase 4 studies
